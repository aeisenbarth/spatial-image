# spatial-image

A multi-dimensional spatial image data structure for scientific Python.

To facilitate:

- Multi-scale processing and analysis
- Registration
- Resampling

on scientific images, which are typically multi-dimensional with anisotropic
sampling, this package provides a spatial-image data structure.
